1. Read an integer `n` from user input.
2. Read a string `s` from user input.
3. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
4. Iterate for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`:
   a. Check if the i-th character of `s` is equal to the (i+1)-th character of `s`:
      - If true, increment `count` by 1.
5. Print the value of `count`.
