1. Define a function is_lucky(n) to determine if a given number n is lucky.
   a. Check if n is divisible by 4 or 7:
      - If true, return True.
   b. Initialize i to 47.
   c. Iterate while i is less than or equal to n:
      i. If i is divisible by 7, increment i by 2.
      ii. Check if i consists only of the digits "4" and "7" and n is divisible by i:
          - If true, return True.
      iii. Increment i by 2.
   d. Return False.

2. Read an integer n from user input.

3. Print "YES" if is_lucky(n) is true, else print "NO".
