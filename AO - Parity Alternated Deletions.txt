1. Read an integer t representing the number of test cases.
2. Read a list of integers s and sort it.
3. Create a list a where each element is the result of x % 2 for each x in s.
4. Check if the count of 1's in a is equal to the count of 0's in a or if their absolute difference is 1.
   - If true, print 0 and exit.
5. Check if the count of 1's in a is greater than the count of 0's in a:
   a. Initialize summing to 0.
   b. Initialize n to 0.
   c. Initialize i to 0.
   d. Iterate while n is less than the absolute difference of counts minus 1:
      i. If the i-th element of s is odd:
         - Add the i-th element to summing.
         - Increment n by 1.
      ii. Increment i by 1.
   e. Print the value of summing.
6. Check if the count of 1's in a is less than the count of 0's in a:
   a. Initialize summing to 0.
   b. Initialize n to 0.
   c. Initialize i to 0.
   d. Iterate while n is less than the absolute difference of counts minus 1:
      i. If the i-th element of s is even:
         - Add the i-th element to summing.
         - Increment n by 1.
      ii. Increment i by 1.
   e. Print the value of summing.
