1. Read testCase from the input.
2. Iterate over each test case using a loop with index i from 0 to testCase - 1.
    a. Read three double values a, b, and c representing the side lengths of a triangle.
    b. Calculate the semi-perimeter s using the formula: s = (a + a + b + b + c + c) / 2.0.
    c. Calculate the total area of the triangle using Heron's formula: total_area = sqrt(s * (s - a - b) * (s - b - c) * (s - c - a)).
    d. Subtract the areas of three individual triangles formed by the sides a, b, and c from the total area.
        i. For each side, calculate the corresponding angle using the law of cosines: angle(opp_A, opp_B, opp_C) = acos((opp_B^2 + opp_C^2 - opp_A^2) / (2 * opp_B * opp_C)).
        ii. Use the area function to calculate the area of a triangle: area(r, angle) = 0.5 * r^2 * angle.
        iii. Subtract the area of each individual triangle from the total area.
    e. Print the result, rounded to 10 decimal places, along with the case number using cout.
3. End of the algorithm.
