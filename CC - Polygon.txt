1. Read an integer `n` from user input.

2. Read a list of integers `s` with `n` elements from user input and sort it in ascending order.

3. Check if the largest element in `s` is less than the sum of all other elements:
   - Print "Yes" if true.
   - Print "No" otherwise.

s[n-1] is the largest of all after short
now sum the rest of the elements using for loop
then check s[n-1]< sum or not
