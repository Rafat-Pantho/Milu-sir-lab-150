1. Read an integer fi as the number of test cases.
2. Repeat the following steps for each test case (from 1 to fi):
    a. Read an integer n.
    b. Read a list of integers a of size n.
    c. Sort the list a.
    d. Initialize a boolean variable fin_of_the_fish to True.
    e. Iterate over the elements of the sorted list a up to the second-to-last element.
    If the difference between the current element and the next element is equal to 1, set fin_of_the_fish to False and break out of the loop.
    f. Print 1 if fin_of_the_fish is True, else print 2.
