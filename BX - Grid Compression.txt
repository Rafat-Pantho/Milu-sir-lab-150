1. Read two integers, `h` and `w`, representing the dimensions of a grid.
2. Read a list of strings `s` representing the grid of size `h`x`w`.
3. Initialize two lists, `row` and `col`, both of size `h` and `w` respectively, with all elements set to False.
4. Iterate through each element in the grid to identify rows and columns containing '#':
   a. For each row `i` from 0 to `h`:
      i. For each column `j` from 0 to `w`:
         - If the element at position `(i, j)` in the grid is '#', set `row[i]` and `col[j]` to True.
5. Iterate through each row:
   a. If `row[i]` is True:
      i. Iterate through each column:
         - If `col[j]` is True, print the element at position `(i, j)` in the grid.
      ii. Print a newline to separate rows.
