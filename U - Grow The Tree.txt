1. Read an integer `n` from user input.
2. Read a list of integers `a` from user input and sort it in ascending order.
3. Calculate the sum of the first half of the sorted list `a[0:(n//2)]` and store it in the variable `sum1`.
4. Calculate the sum of the second half of the sorted list `a[(n//2)::]` and store it in the variable `sum2`.
5. Calculate the square of `sum1` and `sum2` and print the sum of these squares.
