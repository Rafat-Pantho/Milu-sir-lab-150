1. Read two integers `n` and `k`.
2. Read a list of integers `h` and sort it.
3. Check if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`:
   - If true, print 0 and exit.
   - If false:
      a. Initialize a variable `sum1` to 0.
      b. Iterate for `i` in the range from 0 to `(n-k)`:
         i. Add the i-th element of the sorted list `h` to `sum1`.
      c. Print the final value of `sum1`.
