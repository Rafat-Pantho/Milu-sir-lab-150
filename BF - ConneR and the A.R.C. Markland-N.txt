1. Read an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
2. Repeat the following steps for each test case (from 1 to `t`):
   a. Read three integers `n`, `s`, and `k`.
   b. Read a list of integers `a`.
   c. Check if `s` is not in the list `a`:
      - If true, print 0 and move to the next test case.
   d. Iterate for `i` in the range from 0 to `k`:
      i. Check if `s - i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `s - i` is not in the list `a`:
         - If true, print `i` and exit the loop.
      ii. Check if `s + i` is less than or equal to `n` and `s + i` is not in the list `a`:
         - If true, print `i` and exit the loop.
