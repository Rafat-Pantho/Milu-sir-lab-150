1. Read the number of elements (n) and the number of queries (m).
2. Create a set to store elements.
3. Add 0 and the elements from user input into the set.
4. Initialize an iterator to the beginning of the set.
5. Process each query:
   a. Attempt to get the next iterator value.
   b. Check if the iterator is done (reached the end of the set).
      - If true, print "0".
      - If false, print the next iterator value.
