gen(n):
1. Given an integer `n`, the function finds the smallest prime factor of `n`.
2. Iterate over the range of `i` from 2 to the square root of `n` (inclusive).
   a. If `n` is divisible evenly by `i`, return `i` as the smallest prime factor.
3. If no prime factor is found, return `n` as it is a prime number.


main code:
1. Read an integer `n` from user input.
2. Initialize a variable `d` to 0.
3. If `n` is odd:
   a. Find the smallest prime factor of `n` using the `gen` function.
   b. Subtract the smallest prime factor from `n`.
   c. Increment the value of `d` by 1.
4. Print the sum of `d` and `n` divided by 2.
