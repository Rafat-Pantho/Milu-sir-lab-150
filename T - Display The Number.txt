1. Read an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases.
2. Repeat the following steps `t` times:
   a. Read an integer `n` from user input.
   b. Initialize an empty string `max_num`.
   c. Check if `n` is even:
      - If true, set `max_num` to a string consisting of "1" repeated `n//2` times.
      - If false, set `max_num` to the concatenation of "7" and "1" repeated `(n-3)//2` times.
         -> only the left most character will be 7 rest will be one.
   d. Print the value of `max_num`.
