1. Read an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases.
2. Repeat the following steps for each test case:
   a. Read an integer `n` from user input.
   b. Read a list of integers `sa` of length `n` from user input.
   c. Create a new list `s` and set its first element to 2, then extend it with the elements of `sa`.
   d. Initialize a variable `count` to 0.
   e. Iterate over the elements of `s` starting from index 1:
      - Increment `count` by `(s[i] - s[i-1] + 4) // 5`.
   f. Print the result in the format: "Case i: count", where `i` is the current test case index.
