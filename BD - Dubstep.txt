Algorithm: StationDistances

Input:
  - n: number of stations
  - m: number of queries
  - stations: an array to store station positions

1. Create an array named "stations" of size n+1 and initialize the first element to 0.

2. Repeat the following steps n times:
   a. Read the position of a station and store it in the "stations" array.

3. Initialize an index "current_station" to 0.

4. Repeat the following steps m times:
   a. If there is a next station in the array:
      i. Calculate the distance between the current station and the next station.
      ii. Print the calculated distance.
      iii. Update "current_station" to the index of the next station.
   b. If there are no more stations:
      i. Print 0 for the remaining queries.

5. Output: Display the distances between consecutive stations for each query.

End of Algorithm.
