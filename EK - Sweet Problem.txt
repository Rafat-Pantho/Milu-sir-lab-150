1. Read an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases.

2. Repeat the following steps for each test case:
   a. Read three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input and sort them. (read them in an array so you can sort them using sort function)
   b. Calculate the sum of the sorted integers and assign it to a variable `total`.
   c. Print `total // 2` if the largest integer (`a[2]`) is less than or equal to the sum of the two smaller integers (`a[0] + a[1]`).
      Otherwise, print the sum of the two smaller integers (`a[0] + a[1]`).
