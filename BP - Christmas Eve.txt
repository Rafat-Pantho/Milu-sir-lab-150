1. Read two integers `n` and `k`.
2. Create a list `h` by reading `n` integers from user input.
3. Sort the list `h`.
4. Calculate the minimum difference between consecutive elements in subarrays of size `k`:
   a. Iterate for `i` in the range from 0 to `(n-k+1)`:
      i. Calculate the difference between the (i+k-1)-th and i-th elements in the sorted list.
      ii. Find the minimum difference among all calculated differences.
5. Print the minimum difference obtained in step 4.
