1. Initialize a list `storage` with length 1000001, where `storage[0]` is set to 0.
2. Populate the `storage` list using a loop from 1 to 1000000:
   a. Set `storage[i]` to the sum of `storage[i-1]` and the logarithm (base e) of `i`.
3. Read an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases.
4. Repeat the following steps for each test case:
   a. Read two integers `n` and `base` from user input.
   b. Calculate the result using the formula: `int(storage[n] / log(base)) + 1`.
   c. Print the result in the format: "Case i: result", where `i` is the current test case index.
