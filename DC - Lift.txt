1. Read an integer `t` from user input, representing the number of test cases.
2. Repeat the following steps for each test case:
   a. Read two integers `crnt_p_me` and `crnt_p_lift` from user input.
   b. Calculate the total number of steps:
      - Multiply `crnt_p_me` by 4.
      - Add 19.
      - Add the absolute difference between `crnt_p_me` and `crnt_p_lift` multiplied by 4.
   c. Print the result in the format: "Case i: total_steps", where `i` is the current test case index.

Explanation:
- The algorithm takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it reads two integers `crnt_p_me` and `crnt_p_lift`.
- It calculates the total number of steps based on the given formula.
- It prints the result in the specified format for each test case.
