1. Read an integer `s` from user input.

2. Calculate the left and right parts:
   a. `l` is obtained by dividing `s` by 100.
   b. `r` is obtained by taking the remainder of `s` when divided by 100.

3. Check the following conditions:
   a. If 1 <= `l` <= 12:
      i.   If 1 <= `r` <= 12, print "AMBIGUOUS".
      ii.  If not, print "MMYY".
   b. If not, 
      i.   If 1 <= `r` <= 12, print "YYMM".
      ii.  If not, print "NA".
