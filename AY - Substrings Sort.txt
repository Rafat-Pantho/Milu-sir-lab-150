1. Read an integer `n` from user input.
2. Initialize an empty list `s`.
3. Iterate for `n` times:
   a. Read a string and append it to the list `s`.
4. Sort the list `s` based on the length of each string.
5. Iterate for `i` from 0 to `n-2`:
   a. Check if the (i+1)-th string in the sorted list does not contain the i-th string:
      - If true, print "NO" and exit.
6. Print "YES" followed by the strings in the sorted list, each on a new line.
