1. Read an integer `t` from user input.

2. Repeat the following steps for `t` times:
   a. Read two integers `h` and `m` from user input.
   b. Calculate the difference between the total minutes in a day (24 hours) and the given time:
      - Subtract `h` from 24 to get the remaining hours.
      - Multiply the remaining hours by 60 and subtract `m` to get the total minutes remaining in the day.

3. Print the result obtained in step 2b for each test case.

Explanation:

- The algorithm takes an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, it calculates the remaining time in minutes until the end of the day, given the input hours `h` and minutes `m`.
- The result is then printed for each test case.
