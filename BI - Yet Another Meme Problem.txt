1. Read an integer `t` representing the number of test cases.
2. Repeat the following steps for each test case (from 1 to `t`):
   a. Read two integers `A` and `B`.
   b. Calculate the length of the string representation of `B+1` using `len(str(B+1))`.
   c. Print the result of `A` multiplied by the length obtained in step (b).
